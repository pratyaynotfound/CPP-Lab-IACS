### Question 1:
Write a program which takes as input a number of days and converts it into

### Question 2:
Write a program to calculate the following exprossion, where x is a real number:
$$x + \left(\frac{1}{x + \left(\frac{1}{x + \frac{1}{x}}\right)}\right)$$

### Question 3:
Write a program to read the vowels {a, e, i, o, u} in five suitably declared
variables "vowels1" through "vowels5". Are "vowel2 - vowel1", "vowel5 - vowel2" etc.,
valid C++ expressions? What are the values of "vowel2 - vowel1", "vowel5 - vowel2"?
Suppose we have five more variables "capVowel1" through "capVowel5", of the same
type as that of "vowels1" through "vowels5" to store { A, E, I, 0, U} : Does the expression "capVowel2 - capVowel1" have the same value as that of "vowel2 - vowel1"?
Explain your answers.
