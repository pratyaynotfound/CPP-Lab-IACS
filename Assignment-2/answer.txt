# Intended Functionality

If we run 'server.c <port> <file>' in one terminal and in another terminal if we run 'client.c <local host ip>(127.0.0.1) <same port given in server.c>' then we should get the transmitted file and get it in another terminal. And if we are using 2 devices with in the same network then by using same port and the proper ip address of the other computer and transmit the text or message to another computer  



# Errors:

> server.c:
1. The last braces was not closed.
2. 
  if (argc != 3) {
    puts("Usage: server <port> <file>");
    return 1;
  }

  in this snippet we were giving 3 arguments port and transmission file and the file name itself total argument count is 3 but it this case it was 2.

> client.c

1.  int n;
    char bytes[BUFSIZE-1];
    while((n = read(sockfd,bytes,BUFSIZE)) > 0) {
      fwrite(bytes,n,sizeof(char),stdout);
    }

    in this case the bytes was decleared BUFSIZE-1 means if i have 16 bytes total it was declaring for 15 bytes.
