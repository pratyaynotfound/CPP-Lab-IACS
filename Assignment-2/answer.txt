# Intended Functionality

If we run "server.c <port> <file>" in one terminal and "client.c <host ip>(127.0.0.1 for local host) <same port given in server.c>" in another terminal, we should be able to receive the transmitted file. Additionally, if two devices are connected to the same network, sending a text or message to a different computer can be done by using the same port and that computer's correct IP address.  


# Errors:

> server.c:
1. The final brace wasn't closed.
2. 
  if (argc != 3) {
    puts("Usage: server <port> <file>");
    return 1;
  }

  Although the total number of arguments in this snippet was three—port, transmission file, and the file name—in actuality, there were only two.

> client.c

1.  int n;
    char bytes[BUFSIZE-1];
    while((n = read(sockfd,bytes,BUFSIZE)) > 0) {
      fwrite(bytes,n,sizeof(char),stdout);
    }

    In this instance, the bytes were declared as BUFSIZE-1, which means that even though I had 16 bytes total, it was only declaring for 15 bytes.
